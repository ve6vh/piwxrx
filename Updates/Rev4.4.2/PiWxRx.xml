	This is a minimal configuration file to use the USB dongle and gnu radio
	as the audio source. Messages are interpreted, and dumped to the screen
	All versions have to load the Java Native Interface (JNI) libary

	The next stanza identifies the audio source. There are three possibilities:
	an RTL dongle, USB port or a canned audio file. The active configuration is
	for an audio dongle on 162.4MHz, however you can substitute on of the following
	instead.
	<source cmdline="/usr/bin/rtl_fm -M fm -f 162.4M -g 38 -"/>
    <source cmdline="/usr/bin/arecord -D hw:Device,0 -f S16_LE -c 1 -r 48000 -" codec="0" afgain="12" />
 -->
 	 <source cmdline="./filereader.exe -l -f rx48.raw" />

<!--
	As of V4.0, the SIP messaging extension is now specified in the pbx stanza,
	well as the RTP port. The previous messaging stanza has been deprecated.
<pbx ext="5185" url="ve6vh-pbx.local.mesh:5060" secret="ve6vh" rtpport="12557" msgext="5185"></pbx>

<!--	This stanza now covers all of the forwarding methods. All require at least
	the SAME database name, and one of the following forwarding schemes:

	dump	dumps to the console, requires no further arguments.

	sip		sends the raw message to a SIP receiver as a text message for
			further processing. Msgext in the pbx stanza has to be specified.

	email	sends the formatted message to an email address. Depending on the
			server, authentication may be required. If so, set "auth" to "yes"
			and enter the mail user and password, even if they are the same
			as the toaddress.

	post	posts the message to a website, either as an HTTP post or using
			the SOAP protocol. The server address, port, protocol, pagename
			must be specified for both, and for SOAP the XML soap file and
			webmethod must also be specified
